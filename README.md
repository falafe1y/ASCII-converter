# ASCII converter
This is one of my first projects in Python. Please do not judge strictly.

The project is a simple one-page site with a button, when clicked, a file manager opens, in which you need to select a file with the JGP extension. After this and clicking on the "Создать арт" button on the right, art will be created from ASCII characters
